# G.E.O.
Revolutionary Globe-Based Map

Inspiried by Google Earth, Google Maps and Google Street View.

First and foremost, want to thank God above anyone for the technological/engineering prowess that is endowed into man's capability to allow this to be possible. Secondly, Keyhole, Inc. (the original author) and Google (the developer) for the inception and program to build.

Standing on the shoulders of giants, I seek to 'build off of' and invision a revolutionary approach to global and map based representation and imagery of Earth and even other planets within our Solar System--Jovian and minor.

Features to include: 
AI
Deep Learning
Machine Learning
Recursive self-improvement

IPFS (Interplanetary File System) also works intagent with Github. So utilised this repositors (and branches thereof) is also ideal with the site.
